[DETAILS VIEW]: Prev and Next buttons must titled by next and prev item titles
	(Ex.: Details view for News Item 2: {Next-> News Item 3; Prev -> News Item 1})


Ако още се случва да се забележи точно кога 
При мене не работи:
[ADD/EDIT]: Delete Button from first deletion must be display after second deletion closing and reopen delete box..

[SETTINGS]: DB Connection didn't work properly..

	- ddViewListMode Doesn't save to DB selected value..


VIEW - remove paging buttons from code, resx, designer


DETAILS-VIEW: - Paging NEXT & PREV DB loop item records..

*CODE CLEARING!!!
